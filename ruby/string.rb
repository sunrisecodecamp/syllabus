# STRING STUFF

# A string is a set of characters. In Ruby, strings are displayed between quotes.

"Hello, World!"
"Here is one sentence. Here is another sentence." # this is TWO sentences, but ONE string.
"Word"
# TASK 1: Type three strings of varying lengths into irb. 


# Strings can be modified by calling methods on them. Take a look at the examples below.

"Hello, World!".downcase # this will return "hello, world!"
"hello, world!".capitalize # this will return "Hello, world!"
"hello, world!".upcase # this will return "HELLO, WORLD!"
# TASK 2: Test out the downcase, capitalize, and upcase methods on three strings in irb.



# You can figure out the number of characters in a string by calling the length method

"Eldorado".length # this will return 8
"Hello, world!".length # this will return 13 (spaces and punctuation count!)
# TASK 3: Create three strings in irb, then check the length. 



# To display a string in the console, we use the keyword puts

puts "Here is a string that will print out in the console."
# TASK 4: Type puts before three strings in irb.
