# ARRAYS
# Think of an array as a box that can hold various items: strings, integers, booleans, etc.

# Arrays start and end with brackets. 

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

["apple", "banana", "orange", "peach"]

[true, false, false]

[99]

["hello, world!", "You can put a sentence as an item in an array."]

[50, "Las Vegas", false] # Yes, you can mix data types in an array

# You can assign arrays to a variable like this:

my_array = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6]


# HOW TO ACCESS ITEMS INSIDE OF AN ARRAY
# Arrays are indexed with position numbers
# There's a catch: Computers start counting at 0, not 1.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "peach"]

fruits[0] # this will return "apple" since that is the 0th item in the array
fruits[]


# adding elements to an array
