# Computers can do math! Here are some basic math operators you might use:

10 + 2 
10 - 2
10 * 2
10 / 2

10 % 2 # This is the modulo. It will tell you the REMAINDER after dividing. In this case, the remainder is 0.
10 ** 2 # 10 to the power of 2. This will return 100.

# TASK 1: Test that your computer knows how to do math! Type six different 
# math expressions into irb. use both integers and floats.
