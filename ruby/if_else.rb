# COMPUTER LOGIC: IF/ELSE

# In your app, you might want the computer to make a decision at some point.
# One way to do this is to use an if/else statement.
# An example of this in real life might be if a user enters invalid data. How 
# will you have the computer respond?

a = 10
b = 4

if a > b
	puts "a is greater than b."
end

# TASK 1: Create two variables. Compare them using an if statement and get something 
# to print to the console in irb. 

# The above example will only print if a is actually greater than b. If you 
# want something to print if b is greater than a, then you can add an "else" to 
# the if statement.



# Example 1: 
a = 10
b = 4

if a > b
	puts "a is greater than b."
else
	puts "b is greater than a."
end

# Example 2:
a = "happy"
b = "birthday"

if a == b
	puts "The words are the same."
else
	puts "The words are different."
end

# TASK 2: Create two variables. Compare them using an if/else statement and
# get something to print to the console in irb.
