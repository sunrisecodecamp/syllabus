# Welcome to Ruby!

# Ruby is a programming language that was developed in the 
# mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan.

# Ruby is commonly used to develop web applications using 
# a framework called Ruby on Rails.

# You might be wondering why each line starts with a pound sign.
# A pound sign is Ruby's way of telling the computer to ignore 
# what is written. Anything after a pound sign is a comment that
# is meant for humans, not for computers. 

# What we will learn about Ruby today:

	# 1) Data Types, Storing Data, and Comparing Data:
				# Strings
				# Integers and Floats
				# Variables
				# Arrays
				# Booleans
				
	# 2) Ruby Logic
				# If/else
				# Iterating over an array
